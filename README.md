## Data Dashboard
The data contained within this project was gathered within another project focused on using the OpenWeatherMap API to collect weather factors, such as max temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity, for over 500 cities. Once the dataset was currated, MatPlotLib was used to create visuals that showed each factor against the latitude of the city.

## Website
The website includes a landing page, four visual pages, a comparison page, and a data page. The landing page includes a summary section and a visual section with small icons that links to its respective visual page. Each visual page includes a title, the graph, and an explanation. The comparisons page has the four visuals with a title above each plot and each plot links to its respective page. The data page includes the source data constructed in a table.

Within each page, there remains a navigation bar. The navigation bar includes a tab linking to the comparison page, a tab linking to the data page, a tab linking to the homepage, a title linking back to home, and a drop down menu linking to each visual page. When the page size is small, the navigation bar becomes a drop down menu with all of the options above.
